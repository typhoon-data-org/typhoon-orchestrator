"""
Module containing all the functions that can be used to create DAGs.
We typically prefer to pass a connection ID and have the function call get_dag rather than passing it an initialized
 hook because that way we can easily modify a connection by changing it's type and details without having to modify the
 DAG or function (as long as both connections share the same interface) therefore reducing complexity and duplication.
